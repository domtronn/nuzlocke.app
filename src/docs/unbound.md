Welcome to the Pokémon Unbound Nuzlocke guide. Pokémon Unbound is a fan-made game set in the Borrius region with a unique story and challenging gameplay. Your mission is to protect the region from the Shadows, an organization trying to release a dark force that was sealed away centuries ago.

### Key Features

#### Revamped Game Engine

This game has a custom battle engine that matches the quality of Gen 8, with a seamless gameplay experience. You can catch your favorite Pokémon from Gen 1 to 7, and enjoy various quality-of-life features like Unlimited Bag Space, Auto-Run, and Daily Raids.

#### No more HM Slaves

There's a brand new HM system that allows any Pokemon that can learn an HM to use it in the overworld, which means you don't have to carry HM slaves.
