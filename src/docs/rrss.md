Rising Ruby & Sinking Sapphire are fan-made modifications of Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire that offer a unique twist on the original games. These ROM hacks, created by [Drayano](https://twitter.com/drayano60), have been designed to provide a fresh and challenging gaming experience for players.

Rising Ruby & Sinking Sapphire allow you to obtation 721 Pokémon up to Generation 6 and changes the routes to put a large emphasis on Pokémon availability, with every area offering 10-11 new species making it perfect for Nuzlocking! However, the standout feature of these hacks is the increased difficulty level - Trainers have stronger Pokémon, and battles have been adjusted to provide a greater challenge requiring careful consideration of team composition and strategy.

## Key features

- **New typings**
The addition of the Fairy-type allows a few new changes, with Pokémon such as Misdreavus, Dunsparce, Volbeat and Illumise sporting the new typing. There are some other type changes to discover, like Ice/Fighting Beartic, to better suit their designs!

- **Pokémon buffs**
Most weaker Pokémon have been given a boost to their base stats, with no fully evolved Pokémon having a stat total below 440 making them more viable for a Nuzlocke run. Additionally, some Pokémon now have new abilities, with those previously limited to one ability now gaining their hidden ability as a second option, and some having entirely new abilities available. Examples include Gale Wings Chatot and Pixilate Dunsparce. Lastly, some Pokémon have had their types changed 

- **Evolution items & Mega stones**
Trade evolution items, like Dragon Scales and the Reaper cloth, can now be used directly from the item menu and some Poké Marts and item stalls throughout the Hoenn region allow you to buy these rare stones. Mega Stones for Pokémon whose are normally unavailable before beating the Elite Four can also be purchased in shops after gaining the right number of gym badges.

- **Difficult & Diverse fights**
The rosters of every trainer in the game have been modified and now pull from the pool of every Pokémon! Special trainers, such as the Gym Leaders, Elite Four, and rivals, have revamped AI and boast full 6 Pokémon teams that make use of competitive sets with held items, stronger movesets, higher IVs, and perfect abilities. You'll also Mega evolution more common, with random trainers using it against you later in th game. 

## Good luck!

All of these changes create a much more challenging and rewarding versions of Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire and even more so for running a Nuzlocke challenge.

But don't face that challenge alone! This guide covers all the [**Boss Battles**](#boss-summary), their teams, abilities and held items to help you strategise and prepare the perfect run. I'd highly recommend using this tracker to help route your encounters and build your team to give you the best shot at winning this game.
