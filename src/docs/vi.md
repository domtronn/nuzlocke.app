Nuzlocking is a fun and challenging way to play Pokemon games, and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is no exception. However, with the game's open-world design and overworld encounters, the traditional method of random encounters can be difficult to implement. Fortunately, there's where Nuzlocke.app can help!

## Adapating to the open world

But if you still enjoy the randomisation and variety that comes from a nuzlocke, there are a few ways that you can adapt the rules to accommodate Pokemon Scarlet & Violet's open world.

### Pre-select your encounters

You can use the [Nuzlocke.app tracker](/new) and select the **Randomize** feature when making a new game. This will pre-select an available from each location for you to encounter and "hide" them in tall grass under you're ready to reveal them!

### Raid dens

Another interesting way to randomise your encounters in **Pokemon Scarlet & Violet** is to use the new Tera Raid Dens. There are loads of them scattered around every location and you have no idea what will be in it until you arrive.

### Close your eyes

Once you reach a new location, try closing your eyes and wandering around randomly until you hear the familiar sound of battle music. It's a little bit lo-fi but it gets the job done!
