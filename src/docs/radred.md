Pokémon Radical Red is a fan-made ROM hack of Pokémon FireRed and
LeafGreen, which were official remakes of the original Pokémon Red and
Green games. While FireRed and LeafGreen closely follow the original
storyline and mechanics of those games, Radical Red introduces new
features, gameplay mechanics and challenges that make it stand out as
a unique and challenging experience.

### Difficulty settings

Radical Red features multiple difficultis to really tailor the
experince to your play style. When starting a new game you be prompted
to pick from one of the following settings;

- **Hardcore Mode:** This is the most challenging mode in Radical
Red. Players will face tough team compositions and unfair
obstacles. This mode is designed for players who want an extreme
challenge.

- **Restricted Mode:** Restrict Mode places limitations on the types of
Pokemon a player can use. It offers less of the extra challenges of
Hardcore Mode but can still be difficult.

- **Easy Mode:** While still being more difficult than FireRed, Easy Mode is
the most accessible way to play Radical Red. It provides a challenge
but is designed for players who want a less intense experience.

- **Min Grinding Mode:** Normally, Radical Red requires a lot of grinding to
progress, but this mode eliminates the need for excessive
grinding. Players can combine this mode with Easy or Restrict Mode to
make the game more manageable.

If you're finding the journey too challenging, you can drop the
difficulty by speaking to any **Nurse** at a Pokémon center.

not exist in the original games, including

expanded with new areas to explore.

has been added to the game as a post-game area, complete with gym
leaders and Elite Four.

### Follower Pokémon

Everyone's favourite feature is back in Radical Red Radical Red that
allows a Pokémon to follow you around as you travel through the
game. To enable this feature, speak with a Tamer in the Viridian City
Pokémon Center who will ask if you want the first Pokémon in your
party to follow you. The feature can be disabled or re-enabled by
speaking with the same Tamer. It's important to note that the feature
may be buggy, so it's recommended to disable and re-enable it
periodically to avoid any issues.

Overall, Radical Red offers a fresh take on the classic Pokémon games,

and entertained.
