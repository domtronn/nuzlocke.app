Pok√©mon Radical Red is a fan-made ROM hack of Pok√©mon FireRed and
LeafGreen. It introduces new
features, gameplay mechanics and challenges that make it stand out as
a unique and challenging nuzlocking experience.

### Difficulty settings

Radical Red features multiple difficultis to really tailor the
experince to your play style. When starting a new game you be prompted
to pick from one of the following settings;


#### **‚ò†Ô∏è Hardcore Mode**
This is the most challenging mode in Radical
Red. Players will face tough team compositions and unfair
obstacles. This mode is designed for players who want an extreme
challenge.

#### **‚ù§Ô∏è Easy Mode** 
While still being more difficult than FireRed, Easy Mode is
the most accessible way to play Radical Red. It provides a challenge
but is designed for players who want a less intense experience.

#### **üî® Min Grinding Mode**
Normally, Radical Red requires a lot of grinding to
progress, but this mode eliminates the need for excessive
grinding. Players can combine this mode with Easy or Restrict Mode to
make the game more manageable.

If you're finding the journey too challenging, you can drop the
difficulty by speaking to any **Nurse** at a Pok√©mon center.

### Follower Pok√©mon

Everyone's favourite feature is back in Radical Red Radical Red that
allows a Pok√©mon to follow you around as you travel through the
game. To enable this feature, speak with a Tamer in the Viridian City
Pok√©mon Center who will ask if you want the first Pok√©mon in your
party to follow you. The feature can be disabled or re-enabled by
speaking with the same Tamer. It's important to note that the feature
may be buggy, so it's recommended to disable and re-enable it
periodically to avoid any issues.
