Pokémon Radical Red is a fan-made ROM hack of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen that introduces new features, gameplay mechanics, and challenges to provide a unique and exciting nuzlocking experience. This guide focuses on the game's **Hardcode mode**, which is designed for players who want an _extreme_ challenge. It features additional restrictions and limitations on the player, as well as tougher opponents to battle against.

Whether you're a Pokémon fan looking for a new challenge or a nuzlocke enthusiast seeking a unique experience, **Radical Red's Hardcode mode** will push your Pokémon skills & knowledge to the extreme and prove you absolutely can be the very best

A guide for the more accessible Easy mode can be found [here](https://nuzlocke.app/guides/radical-rad).

### Difficulty & Bosses

Be prepared for a real challenge in **Radical Red**! Bosses have max IVs with proper EV spreads and optimized movesets/hold items, and you'll face tough team compositions and unfair obstacles. The battle style is forced to Set, and you won't be able to access your bag against Gym Leaders and other select bosses. Additionally, there's a soft level cap based on the next boss, which prevents you from overleveling your Pokémon and encourages you to re-evaluate your team and strategy to defeat them.

You can find a guide for all of the boss fights

#### **☠️ Hardcore Mode**

This is the most challenging mode in Radical Red for players who want an _extreme_ challenge. This guide details the Boss teams for [**Hardcode Mode**]() so that you don't get caught off guard.

#### **❤️ Easy Mode**

While still being more difficult than FireRed, Easy Mode is the most accessible way to play Radical Red. It provides a challenge but is designed for players who want a less intense experience.

Everyone's favourite feature is back in Radical Red,  allowing a Pokémon to follow you around as you travel through the game. To enable this feature speak with the Tamer in the Viridian City Pokémon Center who will ask if you want the first Pokémon in your party to follow you. The feature can be disabled or re-enabled by speaking with the same Tamer. It's important to note that the feature may be buggy, so it's recommended to disable and re-enable it periodically to avoid any issues.
