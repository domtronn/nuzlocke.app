Emerald Kaizo is a popular rom hack of the original Pokémon Emerald game. It is known for being much more difficult than the base game, with tougher trainers, stronger wild Pokémon, and modified gym leaders. 

## Difficulty

This game is unforgiving and overwhelming for casual play, with enough enemy variety to make it very difficult. The game gets progressively harder as you progress, unlike most hacks where the hardest point is in the early game. You can also only use held items in battles, making it even more challenging. 

While the game is beatable, it is highly recommended to practice before attempting a nuzlocke run. Nuzlocking the Elite Four may be impossible without knowledge of their roster and good luck in acquiring specific Pokémon to counter their teams. 

That being said, excessive grinding should not be necessary. Bosses in the game have enforced level caps that you can see [below](#boss-summary). Equally, there is no need to grind for EVs as you will not receive them in this game. Lastly, you can purchase cheap Rare Candies before the Elite Four to help level up your Pokemon.

## Good luck!

Hopefully that's where this guide can help! Covering all the [**Boss Battles**](#boss-summary), their teams, abilities and held items. As well as checking all the [**encounters**](#encounters) that are available to you.

Good luck with your Emerald Kaizo nuzlocke challenge! Remember, this game is designed to be challenging, so don't be discouraged if you struggle at first. Keep grinding, stay cautious, and don't give up - you'll feel a great sense of accomplishment when you finally beat the game. And most importantly, have fun!

I'd highly recommend using this tracker to help route your encounters and build your team to give you the best shot at winning this game.
